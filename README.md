# Ansible

Basically a simple way to setup some shit that I want in my dev environments.

## What it does

1. Sets up some basic tools
2. Configures my git settings properly (including ssh keys, commit signing)
3. Installs docker

## Disclaimers

1. I'm very new to Ansible. Use these playbooks at your own risk.
2. These should be kinda cross platform. So if you want to mimic a similar setup, fork, and modify the playbooks to suit your own needs.

PS: Ansible is so fucking cool
